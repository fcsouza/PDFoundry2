[Tutorials and resources created by users of PDFoundry can be found here](https://github.com/fcsouza/pdf-character-sheet/wiki/Community-Resources)

## Setup
PDF Character Sheet is easily installable - find it in the modules list inside Foundry VTT. Alternatively, you can use the manifest link below.

### Manifest
> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fcsouza/pdf-character-sheet/master/module.json

## System Developers
I highly recommend you do not bundle PDF Character Sheet - if you do however, the module version will disable itself and display a warning to the user. Instead, you can see the [documentation](https://fcsouza.github.io/pdf-character-sheet/index.html) for an example of checking for the presence of PDF Character Sheet, and enabling additional support if it is found.

### Building PDF Character Sheet
If you wish to build PDF Character Sheet yourself - most commonly because you want to contribute - you can do the following.

1. Clone the repository anywhere
2. Copy `foundryconfig.example.json` and rename it `foundryconfig.json`. Edit the dataPath to your data folder.
2. Open a terminal, navigate to the repository directory
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `gulp build` to perform a one off build, or `gulp watch` to perform incremental builds as you change things

### API Examples

See the [documentation](https://fcsouza.github.io/pdf-character-sheet/index.html) for details and examples.
